TO-DO LIST 

- This application allows users to create to-do lists based on categories they have created and helps them plan their days and weeks in an organized fashion. Users can delete the categories and to-do items by sliding them and pressing the delete icon. They can also mark to-do items as done by tapping on them.

- This application is made for the course 'UDEMY: iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp.' The aim of this project is to study the 'Realm Database' and design custom 'Table View Cells.'
