# TO-DO 
> This is a simple to-do list application.


## General Information
- This application allows users to create to-do lists based on categories they have created and helps them plan their days and weeks in an organized fashion.
- The purpose of this project is to study the 'Realm Database' and to design custom TableView cells with xib files. 


## Technologies Used
- REALM Database. You can find the documentation [here](https://realm.io/realm-swift/).

## Features
- Creating new categories by tapping the plus sign on the top right corner
- Creating new to-do items after choosing a category for the item
- Deleting categories or items by sliding them and tapping the delete icon
- Marking to-do items as done by tapping the item


## Setup
To open this project locally, clone the project and open it in Xcode.


## Usage
- When the project is open for the first time, the Realm dependency might need to be updated; also, Xcode might give an error about the dependency. If that happens, you need to delete the dependencies and add them again with Swift Package Manager.
- To delete the existing dependencies, select your project in the Project Editor. You can find the dependencies in the Package Dependencies tab. You can remove them by clicking the minus "-" sign. 


## Project Status
Project is _complete_.


## Acknowledgements
- While this project is finished with the help of [iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) course, some of the parts are modified and changed.
- The project shown in the course uses different dependencies to change the design of the application. But in this project, the only dependency that is used is Realm Database.
- Different from the project in the course, the custom cell design is made with xib files.
